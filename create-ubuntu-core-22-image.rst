To validate that the store was provisioned correctly, and that you are able to access it, we recommend creating and booting an Ubuntu Core image on amd64.

Creating the gadget snap
------------------------

The first step in building an Ubuntu Core image that can communicate with your store is to build a gadget snap. Gadget snaps do many things, but for our purposes here, the important functionality is generating a serial number and using that serial number, along with a pre-shared API key, to get credentials to talk to the store. You can also use the gadget snap to set default configuration values for application snaps, and auto-connect some interfaces.

To build a custom gadget snap, we start by forking a suitable candidate from the `Canonical supported gadgets <https://snapcraft.io/docs/gadget-snap#heading--setup>`_ and follow these `instructions <https://docs.snapcraft.io/the-gadget-snap/696>`_.

For this particular case, validating the initial store setup, let's fork the ``pc-amd64-gadget``. This gadget enables the device to request store credentials from the Serial Vault, as configured above.

Gadget snaps for Ubuntu Core 22 must be built on the corresponding LTS classic release (Ubuntu 22.04) using ``snapcraft`` 7.x or later. You should also ensure that the build-packages needed to build the gadget snap are already installed, so that you're not required to use sudo when building the snap itself.

.. terminal::
    :input: sudo snap install snapcraft --classic --channel=7.x/stable
    
    ...

    :input: snapcraft version
    snapcraft 7.1.3

.. note::

    As the gadget snap also provides a means to provision static snap configuration for the seeded snaps in an image, you may need to require multiple gadget snaps for different models. It’s also possible to use a single gadget for multiple devices if there are no configuration differences. If you do this, please be aware that you'll need to ensure that the models in the Serial Vault use the same **API KEY**.

.. terminal::
    :scroll:
    :input: sudo apt update

    :input: sudo apt install -y git
    :input: git clone -b <CUSTOMER-UBUNTU-CORE-VERSION> https://github.com/snapcore/pc-gadget <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>
    :input: cd <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>


Update the "name" field in the ``snapcraft.yaml`` to "``<CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>``-pc". Feel free to also adjust the "version", "summary" and "description" to be more meaningful in your context.

Build the snap, using the model **API Key** generated during the Serial Vault setup above:

.. terminal::
    :input: MODEL_APIKEY=<API-key-from-serial-vault> sudo snapcraft --destructive-mode
    
    ...
    Snapped <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc_22-0.1_amd64.snap

.. note::

    The sample “product_serial” is loosely generated (``date -Is``) in this gadget. In production the serial number should be derived from a value inserted during the factory process, or from a unique hardware identifier, for uniqueness and traceability. See :ref:`dmidecode` for an example of how to modify the gadget to use dmidecode (x86 only) to read the serial number from the DMI table.

Now register the snap name in your Base Snap Store and push the initial revision:

.. terminal::
    :input: snapcraft whoami

    email:        <CUSTOMER-BRAND-EMAIL>
    developer-id: <CUSTOMER-BRAND-ACCOUNT-ID>

    :input: snapcraft register <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc --store=<CUSTOMER-STORE-ID>
    ...
    you, and be the software you intend to publish there? [y/N]: y
    Registering <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc.
    Congrats! You are now the publisher of '<CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc'.

    :input: snapcraft push <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc_22-0.1_amd64.snap
    The Store automatic review failed.
    A human will soon review your snap, but if you can't wait please write in the snapcraft forum asking for the manual review explicitly.

    If you need to disable confinement, please consider using devmode, but note that devmode revision will only be allowed to be released in edge and beta channels.
    Please check the errors and some hints below:
      - (NEEDS REVIEW) type 'gadget' not allowed

.. note::

    The Brand Account must be a **Publisher** under "Manage Users and their roles" to register and publish the gadget snap.

Log into the web dashboard as ``{{ CUSTOMER_ADMIN_EMAIL }}`` (because it has the **Reviewer** role on the ``<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-NAME>`` store), access the `reviews page <https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/reviewer/{{ CUSTOMER_STORE_ID }}/>`_ and **Approve** the gadget revision. All gadget uploads require manual review.

.. note::

    One other important capability of the Reviewer role is the ability to grant "self-serve" interface connections for snaps published in the Brand Store. See `Self-serve Snap Interfaces <https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/docs/brandstores/self-serve-interfaces.html>`_ for more details.

Once the revision is approved, use snapcraft to release it in the stable channel:

.. terminal::
    :input: snapcraft whoami

    email:        <CUSTOMER-BRAND-EMAIL>
    developer-id: <CUSTOMER-BRAND-ACCOUNT-ID>

    :input: snapcraft release <CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc 1 stable
    Track    Arch    Channel    Version    Revision
    latest   all     stable     22-0.1     1
                     candidate  ^          ^
                     beta       ^          ^
                     edge       ^          ^
    The 'stable' channel is now open.

The gadget snap is now available for installation from the ``<CUSTOMER-STORE-NAME>`` store, and for inclusion in images.

.. _dmidecode:

Using dmidecode to read system serial number
********************************************

One possible approach to populating the serial number (vs. using the ``date`` command as described above) is to use the ``dmidecode`` tool to read the system serial number from the DMI table. In order to do this, you would need to add ``dmidecode`` to that gadget's ``snapcraft.yaml`` file as a ``stage-package``:

.. code:: yaml

    prepare-device:
      plugin: nil
      stage-packages:
        - dmidecode
    ...

You also will need to plug the snapd ``hardware-observe`` interface to allow ``dmidecode`` access to access the correct file(s) in sysfs.

.. code:: yaml

    hooks:
      prepare-device:
        plugs: [hardware-observe]
    ...

The actual command to read the serial number will also need to be updated in the prepare-device part:

.. code:: yaml

    prepare-device:
    ...
          product_serial=\$(dmidecode -s system-serial-number)
    ...

Creating the model assertion
----------------------------

One final step before you can build a custom Ubuntu Core image is creation of a signed model assertion, which provides image related metadata which ubuntu-image uses to customise the image. In order to sign the model assertion, a brand model key must be created and registered using the brand account. For details on how to create and register a model key, please refer to `Sign a model assertion <https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/sign-model-assertion>`_.

Once a valid model key is available, create and sign the model assertion for your test Ubuntu Core image:

.. terminal::
    :input: cat << EOF > <CUSTOMER-MODEL-NAME>-model.json

    {
      "type": "model",
      "authority-id": "<CUSTOMER-BRAND-ACCOUNT-ID>",
      "brand-id": "<CUSTOMER-BRAND-ACCOUNT-ID>",
      "series": "16",
      "model": "<CUSTOMER-MODEL-NAME>",
      "store": "<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-ID>",
      "architecture": "amd64",
      "base": "core<CUSTOMER-UBUNTU-CORE-VERSION>",
      "grade": "signed",
      "snaps": [
        {
          "default-channel": "latest/stable",
          "id": "<CUSTOMER-SNAP-IDS>",
          "name": "<CUSTOMER-STORE-PREFIX>-pc",
          "type": "gadget"
        },
        {
          "default-channel": "22/stable",
          "id": "pYVQrBcKmBa0mZ4CCN7ExT6jH8rY1hza",
          "name": "pc-kernel",
          "type": "kernel"
        },
        {
          "default-channel": "latest/stable",
          "id": "amcUKQILKXHHTlmSa7NMdnXSx02dNeeT",
          "name": "core22",
          "type": "base"
        },
        {
          "default-channel": "latest/stable",
          "id": "PMrrV4ml8uWuEUDBT8dSGnKUYbevVhc4",
          "name": "snapd",
          "type": "snapd"
        },
        {
          "default-channel": "latest/stable",
          "id": "<CUSTOMER-SNAP-IDS>",
          "name": "<CUSTOMER-REQUIRED-SNAPS>",
          "type": "app"
        }
      ],
      "timestamp": "$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%TZ)"
    }
    EOF

    :input: snapcraft list-keys
        Name          SHA3-384 fingerprint
    *   serial        <fingerprint>
    *   model         <fingerprint>

    :input: snap sign -k model <CUSTOMER-MODEL-NAME>-model.json > <CUSTOMER-MODEL-NAME>-model.assert

.. note::

    The timestamp for model assertion MUST be after the date of the model signing key being registered by snapcraft.

Log in to the web dashboard as ``<CUSTOMER-ADMIN-EMAIL>`` (because it has the Admin role on the ``<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-NAME>`` store), access the `View and manage snaps <https://snapcraft.io/admin>`_ page. Use the “Include snap” dialog to ensure that all snaps listed in the model assertion but published in the Global store (like pc-kernel in this case) get included in your private store. The core, core18, core20, core22 and snapd packages are included automatically and cannot be removed.

Access the snap page https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/snaps/SNAPNAME to get the snap-id and fill the fields ``<CUSTOMER-SNAP-IDS>`` and ``<CUSTOMER-REQUIRED-SNAPS>``.

Switching to a developer account
--------------------------------

Now that the model has been signed by the *Brand Account*, there is no need to continue to use such powerful credentials. We recommend switching to a developer account to seed images.

The account used must have the **Viewer** role on the ``<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-NAME>`` store. Log in to the web dashboard as ``<CUSTOMER-ADMIN-EMAIL>`` (because it has the Admin role on the ``<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-NAME>`` store), go to "Manage Users and their roles" to add a developer account and then set it as **Viewer**. You may also give ``<CUSTOMER-ADMIN-EMAIL>`` the **Viewer** role.

Set up authentication for downloading snaps from the ``<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-NAME>`` store:

.. terminal::
    :input: snapcraft whoami

    email:        <CUSTOMER-VIEWER-EMAIL>
    developer-id: <CUSTOMER-VIEWER-ACCOUNT-ID>

    :input: snapcraft export-login --acls package_access store.auth
    Enter your Ubuntu One e-mail address and password.
    ...
    This exported login is not encrypted. Do not commit it to version control!

.. note::

    Exported credentials have a default expiration of 12 months, so (a) treat them with care, and (b) note that they may need to be refreshed sometime in the future.

Creating the image
------------------

This section describes the details of Ubuntu Core image building against the ``<CUSTOMER-DEVICEVIEW-NAME>`` store.

Ensure a Linux build environment (Ubuntu 22.04 or later) and tool for building images are available:

.. terminal::
    :input: sudo snap install ubuntu-image --classic
    
    ...

Ubuntu Core image is built in the one line instruction by using the above developer account credential:

.. terminal::
    :input: UBUNTU_STORE_AUTH=$(cat store.auth) ubuntu-image snap <CUSTOMER-MODEL-NAME>-model.assert

    ...

.. note::

    It's also possible to test your gadget snap without releasing it to the store. If you do this, you'll need to copy the .snap file to the directory you're running ubuntu-image in, ensure that your model assertion removes the snap-id and channel for the gadget snap, and use the ``--snap=ubuntu-image`` command-line option to instruct ``ubuntu-image`` to use the local snap.

Launching and verifying the image
---------------------------------

To launch and test your newly generated Ubuntu Core image, follow the steps here: `Ubuntu Core: Testing with QEMU <https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/testing-with-qemu>`_. Once the image is booted and installed, login and then verify if the seeded snaps are installed, the ``<CUSTOMER-MODEL-NAME>`` ``model`` is correct and a serial assertion was obtained:
