A Dedicated Snap Store is a custom application store tailored to software
distribution across fleets of devices. This store allows you to create, publish
and distribute software on one centralized platform, with reliable over-the-air
updates to your devices in a secure and validated way. Dedicated Snap Stores are
adopted by a large number of enterprises around the world, with a variety of IoT
use cases. It is the private, enterprise equivalent of the global Snap Store.
